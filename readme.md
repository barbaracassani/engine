# Yip Engine/API/Library

**IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

The core engine behind Yip, exposed as a node module consumable by... *well, anything*. Yet to be released/published.

## General Todo

 * Flesh-out schemas for Report, Update & User
 * Begin Report actions
 * Begin Report metrics considerations
 * Begin Engine logic considerations

## Engine notes

### Engine logic

I.e. The high level logic concerning relationships, credibility, metrics, heuristics, profiling, etc.

### Todo: Consider / Think About / Develop:

 * Diffusion ticker / checker ( governs popularity )
 * Location tap ( for discovery )
 * User-made judgements ( voting, rating, etc. )
 * Moderation hooks ( moderation queueing, user/mod profiling for suitability )
 * User credibility governance ( hooks for credibility consideration )
 * Meaningful metric API consideration ( exposed metrics, bounds, stats )
